## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.2] - 2026-05-14

### Changed

- Refresh transitive and minor-bump dependency versions via `cargo update`
  within existing semver carets. No public API or CLI behavior changes. Notable
  resolved versions: `tauri` 2.10.3 → 2.11.1, `tauri-plugin` 2.5.4 → 2.6.1,
  `tauri-build` 2.5.6 → 2.6.1, `tokio` 1.50.0 → 1.52.3, `wry` 0.54.4 → 0.55.1,
  `rmcp` 1.5.0 → 1.7.0, `thiserror` 2.0.x → 2.0.18, `tower-http` 0.6.8 →
  0.6.10, `tray-icon` 0.21.3 → 0.23.1, `wasm-bindgen` 0.2.117 → 0.2.121.
  Breaking-only upgrades (`quick-xml` 0.36 → 0.40, `toml` 0.8 → 1.x, `windows`
  0.61 → 0.62) intentionally deferred to dedicated PRs.
- Refresh `docs/` npm dependencies via `npm update --save`. Bumps `astro`
  6.1.9 → 6.3.2 (closes `npm audit` advisory GHSA-xr5h-phrj-8vxv on server
  islands, plus patch fixes for HMR `HTMLElement` errors and double-encoded
  URL handling), `@astrojs/starlight` 0.38.4 → 0.38.5, `sharp` 0.34.2 →
  0.34.5. Astro 6.4 and Starlight 0.39 deferred (both involve breaking
  changes). Supersedes #90.

### Fixed

- `wait` no longer caps user-supplied `--timeout` at the internal Rust default
  (10 s). The handler dispatched `wait` through the generic `handle_eval_method`
  with `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`, so any `--timeout` above 10 000 ms produced a cryptic
  `Eval error: eval timed out after 10s` instead of the bridge's well-formed
  `Timeout waiting for <selector>` rejection. The reporter on issue #91 surfaced
  this as "`wait --selector` silently fails for UUID values" — the UUID was a
  coincidence: their UUID-bearing kanban rows simply rendered after the 10 s
  cap. `wait` now joins `watch` on a shared `bridge_eval_timeout` helper that
  pads the JS-side timeout with a 2 s headroom buffer ([#91]).
- `bridge.js` `waitFor`: explicit `timeout: 0` is honored as "resolve or reject
  immediately" instead of being coerced to the 10 000 ms default via
  `||`-fallback. The previous behavior desynchronised the JS timer from the
  padded Rust channel and could surface the generic "eval timed out" error for
  `wait --timeout 0`. Matches the `watch` semantics that already used a
  `!= null` check ([#91]).

### Security

- `SKILL.md`: addressed skills.sh Snyk findings W007 (insecure credential
  handling) and W011 (third-party content exposure). Replaced the literal
  `user@example.com` / `password123` pair in the login-flow example with
  `$TEST_EMAIL` / `$TEST_PASSWORD` env-var references, added a "Credential
  Safety" preamble that also flags `record` recordings and `replay --export
  sh` shell scripts as credential-bearing artifacts to scrub before sharing,
  and added an "Untrusted WebView content" guard instructing the agent to
  treat output from `eval`, `html`, `text`, `attrs`, `value`, `logs`,
  `network`, and `screenshot` as data to inspect — not instructions to
  follow — and to escalate suspected indirect prompt-injection attempts.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- `fill` and `type` actions now work on `<textarea>`. The bridge previously grabbed the `value` setter via `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(HTMLInputElement.prototype, "value") || Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(HTMLTextAreaElement.prototype, "value")` — but the first descriptor is always truthy, so the textarea fallback was unreachable and the input setter was applied to a textarea, throwing `The HTMLInputElement.value setter can only be used on instances of HTMLInputElement` (WebIDL `[LegacyUnforgeable]` brand check). The bridge now resolves the setter via `Object.getPrototypeOf(el)`, which works uniformly across `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` (and also fixes a latent variant of the same bug for inputs sourced from another realm/iframe). The React controlled-input bypass that already existed for plain `<input>` is preserved unchanged ([#85]).

### Changed

- `select` action now validates the target tag explicitly: misrouted selectors that resolve to an `<input>`, `<textarea>`, or any non-`<select>` element fail fast with `select requires a <select> element, got: <tag>` instead of silently writing to the wrong element. The pre-refactor implicit type guard came from the `HTMLSelectElement.prototype.value` brand check; the new `nativeValueSetter` helper picks the setter from the element's own prototype, so the guard was made explicit. The check is tag-based (`el.tagName.toLowerCase() === "select"`) rather than `instanceof`, so `<select>` elements coming from another window/iframe realm continue to work ([#85]).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Windows support** — named pipe server and client for Windows, with security hardening (DACL, SID validation), registry-based instance discovery, and platform-specific tests ([#64])
- **Batch scenario runner** — `tauri-pilot run <scenario.toml>` executes declarative TOML scenarios with 18 action types (click, fill, type, press, select, check, scroll, navigate, wait, watch, eval, screenshot, assert-text, assert-exists, assert-visible, assert-hidden, assert-value, assert-url). Supports `fail_fast` (default true), `--no-fail-fast` override, `--junit <file>` for JUnit XML output, and auto-captures failure screenshots to `./tauri-pilot-failures/`. Exit code 0 = all pass, 1 = any failure. Example: `docs/examples/login-flow.toml` ([#62])
- `connect.timeout_ms` in TOML scenarios — wraps `Client::connect` in `tokio::time::timeout` ([#63])
- `global_timeout_ms` in TOML scenarios — hard deadline around `run_scenario` ([#63])
- Per-step `timeout_ms` applied to all non-`wait`/`watch` actions via `tokio::time::timeout` ([#63])
- `<testsuites>` JUnit XML root now carries `tests`, `failures`, `errors`, `skipped`, `time` aggregate attributes for CI reporters (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Allure) ([#63])

### Fixed

- **Windows security hardening** — fixed heap overflow in ACL allocation, use-after-free on the SID buffer, a no-op peer-SID check (`OpenProcessToken` on the impersonated thread replaced with `OpenThreadToken`), UB on the alloc-failure path, silent fallback to a broader default DACL, and a permanently-aborting accept loop. Also switched `instances_dir` creation to `std::fs::create_dir_all` for correctness on clean profiles, and added a regression test asserting the bound pipe carries a user-only DACL with one ACE ([#64])
- `tauri-pilot-cli` Windows builds now enable the `Win32_Foundation` and `Win32_System_Threading` features on the `windows` crate so `is_pid_alive` compiles on Windows CI ([#64])
- `tauri-plugin-pilot` marks the Linux-target `enigo` entry as `optional = true` so `--no-default-features` actually drops the dependency — previously the `press` feature gate was silently defeated by cargo merging the target-specific entry with the top-level one ([#64])
- `tauri-plugin-pilot` server now caps per-line reads using `AsyncReadExt::take` before invoking `read_line`, so a peer flooding bytes without a newline can no longer OOM the host process — the existing `MAX_LINE_LENGTH` check was applied after the full line had already been buffered ([#64])
- `tauri-pilot-cli` Unix client tests use a per-process, atomic-counter socket path instead of hard-coded `/tmp/tauri-pilot-test-*.sock` paths, so parallel `cargo test` runs no longer cross-wire through the same socket file ([#64])
- `tauri-pilot-cli` Windows registry-resolution tests mock entries with `std::process::id()` instead of a fabricated dead PID, so the liveness filter added in the Windows support work doesn't skip them ([#64])
- `assert-exists` now verifies the `visible` key is present in the RPC response to catch missing DOM elements ([#63])
- `scroll top` and `scroll bottom` now actually scroll. Previously the bridge `scroll()` only computed dx/dy for `up`/`down`/`left`/`right`, so `top` and `bottom` returned `✓ ok` while `scrollBy(0, 0)` was a silent no-op. The bridge now uses `scrollTo(scrollX, 0)` for `top` and `scrollTo(scrollX, max(documentElement.scrollHeight, body.scrollHeight) - documentElement.clientHeight)` for `bottom` on the window (preserves horizontal scroll, quirks-mode safe, excludes any horizontal scrollbar height that `window.innerHeight` would otherwise count), and `scrollTop = 0` / `scrollTop = scrollHeight - clientHeight` on element refs. Unknown directions now throw instead of silently no-op (behavior change: scripts that previously got `{ ok: true }` for typos like `"Down"` will now get an error). The MCP `scroll` tool schema also exposes `top` and `bottom` in its direction enum, and `docs/reference/cli.md` lists them ([#73])
- `tauri-pilot wait <target>` (positional) is now parsed the same way as `click`, `text`, `value`, etc.: `@x` is a snapshot ref, anything else is a CSS selector. Previously the positional was forwarded raw and the bridge always treated it as a snapshot ref via `idMap.get`, so `tauri-pilot wait "#trigger-deferred"` timed out even when the element existed ([#74])
- `wait` TOML scenario steps now honor the `ref = "e1"` field on `[[step]]` entries (the same field already accepted by `scroll` etc.), routing through the shared `build_wait_params` helper instead of silently dropping it ([#74])
- `tauri-pilot wait` and the bridge `waitFor` now reject up-front when neither `selector` nor `ref` is provided (including the `@`-alone edge case where `parse_target` would otherwise produce an empty ref), instead of silently waiting on a `MutationObserver` until the timeout fires ([#74])
- Bridge `waitFor` reads `options.ref` (was `options.target`) so its protocol matches `resolveTarget`, the field name used by every other element-targeting handler ([#74])
- The MCP `wait` tool now routes through the same `build_wait_params` helper so MCP clients get the auto-detection fix without their own code change ([#74])
- Scoped the `press` + global-shortcut claim from PR #45 / `[0.4.0]`. On X11, `enigo`'s `XTestFakeKeyEvent` backend does not reliably satisfy the `XGrabKey` passive grabs used by `tauri-plugin-global-shortcut`'s Linux backend, so registered global shortcuts may not fire. DOM listeners and Tauri accelerators are unaffected. See [#75], the README's "Known limitations" section, and the `press` reference docs for the mechanism and the documented workaround.
- `tauri-pilot eval` now auto-wraps top-level `await` in an async IIFE so the natural shape works (`await Promise.resolve("hi")`, `await fetch("/api").then(r => r.json())`). Previously the bridge fell through to indirect eval — a script context where top-level `await` is forbidden — and surfaced an opaque `Unexpected identifier 'Promise'` error instead of pointing at the real cause. The bridge now compiles in three stages (expression → async-expression → async-statement-IIFE-when-await-is-detected → indirect-eval) and emits a clear error pointing back at `docs/reference/cli.md` when none of them parse. Multi-statement scripts that want to surface a value still need an explicit `return`. ([#79])
- `tauri-pilot --json snapshot --save <path>` now emits a self-describing JSON object on stdout: the saved file path is merged into the result as `"path"` (alongside `"elements"`), matching the `record stop --output` and `screenshot` conventions. Pipelines like `... | jq` or `... | python -c 'json.load(sys.stdin)'` are no longer at the mercy of stderr/stdout interleaving. Also routed `tracing` output to stderr in CLI mode so `RUST_LOG`-driven log lines can never corrupt a `--json` payload (it was already routed to stderr in `mcp` mode). The human-readable "Snapshot saved to <path>" line is still printed to stderr ([#80]).

### Changed

- Clippy cleanup / no-suppression policy: remove speculative Windows helpers (`discover_instances`, `find_newest_instance`, `is_pid_alive`), scope test-only imports inside `mod tests` blocks, replace `.unwrap()`/`.unwrap_err()` in tests with `.expect()`/`.expect_err()` to satisfy the workspace `clippy::unwrap_used = "deny"` without module-level `#[allow]` escapes, and fix `cast_precision_loss`/`cast_possible_truncation` via `Duration::as_secs_f64` and `Value::as_i64`. Also retry on `ERROR_PIPE_BUSY` when connecting to the Windows Named Pipe so `client::windows::connect` has a genuine await instead of `#[allow(clippy::unused_async)]`
- `tauri-plugin-pilot` `init()` doc comment clarifies the no-op fallback now excludes Windows too and mentions the Named Pipe server path ([#64])
- Bumped `windows` crate `0.52` → `0.61` on both `tauri-plugin-pilot` and `tauri-pilot-cli`, aligning with the version already pulled transitively by `tauri`/`tao`/`wry`/`webview2-com`/`enigo`. Deduplicates the Windows dependency graph (removes the parallel `windows-targets` tree shipped with 0.52) and picks up the `HANDLE(*mut c_void)` layout matching `std::os::windows::raw::HANDLE`. Mechanical breaking changes: `HANDLE(0)` → `HANDLE(std::ptr::null_mut())`, `HANDLE(raw as isize)` → `HANDLE(raw)`, `self.0.0 != 0` → `!self.0.0.is_null()`, `PSID` import relocated from `Win32::Foundation` to `Win32::Security`, `BOOL` now lives in `windows::core`, `SetSecurityDescriptorDacl` takes `Option<*const ACL>` (cast via `.cast_const()`), `GetSecurityInfo` returns `WIN32_ERROR` (use `.ok()`), `LocalFree` takes `Option<HLOCAL>` ([#68])
- Bumped `indicatif` from `0.17` to `0.18` (brings the transitive `console` update to `0.16`; only `ProgressBar::new_spinner()` is used — API stable)
- Bumped docs dependencies: `astro` `6.1.3` → `6.1.9`, `@astrojs/starlight` `0.38.2` → `0.38.4`, transitively `vite` `7.3.1` → `7.3.2`
- Refreshed `Cargo.lock` patch-level updates: `libc` `0.2.184` → `0.2.186`, `clap` / `clap_derive` `4.6.0` → `4.6.1`, `assert_cmd` `2.2.0` → `2.2.1`

### Security

- Resolved Dependabot alerts #1–#4 (all in `docs/`):
  - `astro` XSS via `define:vars` incomplete `</script>` sanitization ([GHSA-j687-52p2-xcff](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j687-52p2-xcff), CVE-2026-41067) — patched upstream in `astro@6.1.6`; included via bump to `astro@6.1.9`
  - `vite` path traversal in optimized deps `.map` handling ([GHSA-4w7w-66w2-5vf9](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4w7w-66w2-5vf9), CVE-2026-39365)
  - `vite` `server.fs.deny` bypass via query parameters ([GHSA-v2wj-q39q-566r](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v2wj-q39q-566r), CVE-2026-39364)
  - `vite` arbitrary file read via dev-server WebSocket ([GHSA-p9ff-h696-f583](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p9ff-h696-f583), CVE-2026-39363)
  - All three `vite` CVEs fixed transitively via `astro@6.1.9` → `vite@7.3.2`

### Removed

- `.gitignore` no longer ignores `CLAUDE.md`, `.sisyphus/`, `.agents/`, or `skills-lock.json` — these are personal tooling entries that belong in a user-level `~/.gitignore_global`, not in the repo ([#64])

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- `eval` command now reads the script from stdin when the argument is `-` or omitted ([#41])
- Stdin heredoc and pipe examples for `eval -` in README, SKILL.md, and CLI reference ([#50])
- MCP server mode for exposing tauri-pilot commands as structured tools over stdio ([#51])
- `watch --require-mutation` flag defers the stability timer until at least one DOM mutation occurs, then waits for `--stable` ms of quiet. Rejects on timeout if nothing mutated. Use after IPC calls that trigger async re-renders (e.g. React state updates) where you need to block until the re-render lands ([#49])

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `watch` default semantics changed — the stability timer now arms at startup instead of on the first mutation. Idle runs resolve after `--stable` ms with an empty change set (`{added:[], removed:[], modified:[]}`) instead of rejecting with a "no DOM changes" timeout error. Scripts that relied on `watch` as a "did anything change?" assertion should switch to `watch --require-mutation` to keep the old reject-on-idle behaviour ([#49])
- `press` command now injects keyboard events at the OS level via `enigo` instead of dispatching synthetic JS `KeyboardEvent`s. Events are now `isTrusted=true` and traverse the full input pipeline, reaching DOM listeners, Tauri accelerators, and global shortcut handlers ([#45])
- The plugin now requests window focus before injecting keys so events land on the correct webview
- `tauri-plugin-pilot` exposes a default-on `press` feature that gates the `enigo` dependency. Build with `--no-default-features` to drop it from release builds where the whole plugin is already no-op'd ([#53])
- Bumped MSRV from Rust 1.94.0 to **1.95.0** (workspace `Cargo.toml`, `ci.yml`, `release.yml`). Public docs (README, CONTRIBUTING, docs site) updated and the inaccurate "LTS" wording dropped — Rust does not yet ship an LTS channel ([#54])

### Fixed

- `eval` now accepts `const`, `let`, `var`, function declarations and other statements — the previous `new Function("return (…)")` wrapper forced an expression context and rejected top-level declarations. Scripts now run through indirect `eval`, which returns the completion value of the last expression ([#46])
- `click` now dispatches pointer events before mouse events so Radix UI dropdown, select, and dialog triggers open correctly ([#52])
- `press "Control+1"` and similar combos now trigger Tauri global shortcuts and any handler that requires trusted keyboard events ([#45])
- `press` with an explicit `--window <label>` now returns an error when the target window cannot be focused, instead of silently delivering the key to whatever window currently holds focus ([#53])
- `press` serializes the full `focus → settle → inject` sequence, so two concurrent calls targeting different windows can no longer race on the focus step and cross their keys ([#53])
- `press` combo parser now rejects empty segments between `+` (e.g. `Control++P`, `+A`) instead of silently normalizing them into different shortcuts ([#53])
- `press` now explicitly enables enigo's `wayland` backend so OS-level key injection works on Wayland sessions, not just X11 ([#53])
- `press` validates the combo string before taking the focus lock or stealing focus, so malformed input returns `-32602` (invalid params) immediately instead of `-32603` after an 80ms focus settle ([#53])
- `simulate_press` now propagates modifier-release failures instead of dropping them, so a combo can no longer return `Ok(())` while leaving a modifier stuck down ([#53])
- `press` with `--window <label>` but no focus hook installed now errors instead of silently injecting into whatever window has focus ([#53])
- `Enigo::new` failure hint about macOS Accessibility permission is now gated to macOS builds — Linux and Windows errors no longer point users at the wrong remediation ([#53])
- `press` JoinError handling distinguishes panics from cancellation and runtime-shutdown cases instead of reporting every failure as "panicked" ([#53])
- `eval` now exits with code 0 when the JS expression returns `undefined` (e.g. `element.click()`, void functions). Previously the CLI bailed with `Error: Server returned empty result without error`, breaking bash `&&` chains and `set -e` scripts even though the eval had succeeded ([#48])

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- **macOS support** — CI verification on macOS, updated documentation and platform requirements ([#37])

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-05

### Security

- **Socket hardening** — three layers of defense against local privilege escalation ([#31])
  - Socket permissions set to `0o600` (owner-only) immediately after bind
  - `umask(0o177)` guard around bind to eliminate TOCTOU race window
  - Peer credential (UID) verification rejects connections from other local users
  - Socket placed in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (user-private `0o700` directory) with `/tmp` fallback
  - `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` validated for ownership and permissions before use
  - CLI `resolve_socket()` filters candidates by UID ownership

  - `tauri-pilot drag @e5 --offset 0,100` — drag by pixel offset
  - `tauri-pilot drop @e3 --file ./test.png` — simulate file drop on element
  - Dispatches full HTML5 drag event sequence: `dragstart`, `dragenter`, `dragover`, `drop`, `dragend`
- **DOM watch command** — observe DOM mutations with MutationObserver, debounce until stable, and return a change summary ([#10])
  - `tauri-pilot watch` — block until any DOM change, print summary
  - `--timeout` timeout in ms, `--selector` scope to subtree, `--stable` debounce duration
  - Uses `MutationObserver` with `childList`, `subtree`, `attributes`, `characterData`
